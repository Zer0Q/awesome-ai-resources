## Lo-code no-code AI Tools

- [Langflow](https://www.langflow.org)

  > **open source web tool built in Python that provides a graphical LLM interface to work with LangChain**, allowing to handle the concepts of Chains, Agents and Prompt Engineering, in a very simple way

## AI Frameworks

- [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com)

>LangChain is an open source orchestration framework for the development of applications using [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.ibm.com/blog/open-source-large-language-models-benefits-risks-and-types/). Available in both Python- and Javascript-based libraries, LangChain’s tools and APIs simplify the process of building LLM-driven applications like [chatbots](https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots) and [virtual agents](https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-agent)
